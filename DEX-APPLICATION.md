# Hey Dex Team ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devanshu, and I built something that I think you'll find interesting.

## What I Built

I spent the last few weeks building [ModerKit](https://github.com/DevanshuNEU/moderkit-extension) - a Chrome extension that does real-time content moderation using AI. But here's the thing: while building it, I kept thinking "this is exactly what Dex is doing, just for content instead of browsing."

The extension analyzes web content as you browse, learns from your preferences, and gets smarter over time. It remembers context across sessions, works seamlessly in the background, and actually makes browsing better without getting in your way.

## Why This Matters

When I read about Dex's vision for browser-based AI that learns and adapts, I realized I had already started building a piece of that future. The challenges are the same:

- **Memory that persists** - How do you maintain context across browser sessions?
- **Real-time processing** - How do you analyze content without killing performance?
- **User learning** - How do you get better at understanding what someone actually wants?
- **Seamless integration** - How do you enhance browsing without disrupting it?

I've been wrestling with these exact problems, and honestly, it's been fascinating.

## The Technical Stuff (If You're Curious)

- Built on Manifest V3 with proper service worker architecture
- Integrates Google's Gemini AI for content analysis
- Has a persistent memory layer that learns from user interactions
- Processes content in parallel without blocking the UI
- Uses smart caching to keep analysis under 100ms

The whole codebase is about 5,000+ lines of production-ready JavaScript. Nothing groundbreaking, but it works reliably and the architecture is clean.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm graduating from Northeastern in May and genuinely excited about what you're building. The browser is becoming the new OS, and AI is becoming the new interface. That intersection is where I want to spend my time.

I've got 2+ years of full-stack experience (worked at Jaksh Enterprise and Pitney Bowes), but more importantly, I've proven I can ship. This extension isn't just a side project - it's a working demonstration that I understand the problems you're solving.

## Why Dex?

Honestly? Because you're building something that doesn't exist yet but absolutely should. The current state of browser AI is terrible - it's either privacy-invasive or completely disconnected from context. You're trying to fix that, and I want to help.

I've been following YC companies for years, and the best ones solve problems that seem obvious in retrospect. Better browser intelligence feels like one of those problems.

## What's Next?

I'd love to chat about what you're building and share what I've learned from building ModerKit. I can demo the extension live, walk through the architecture, or just talk about the challenges of building browser-based AI that actually works.

I'm not looking for a specific role - I just want to work on hard problems with smart people. If there's a fit, great. If not, I'd still love to learn from what you're doing.

Thanks for reading,

**P.S.** - The extension is ready to install if you want to try it. Just clone the repo and load it in Chrome developer mode. Takes about 30 seconds to set up.

**P.P.S.** - I know cold emails can be annoying, but I figured building something relevant was better than just sending a generic application. Hope that's not presumptuous.
