## 🚀 Application Strategy

### Direct Approach
**Email Regina (CEO):** regina@getdexterity.com
```
Subject: Full-Stack Engineer - Built Working Browser AI Extension

Hi Regina,

I built a Chrome extension that demonstrates exactly what Dex is building:
https://github.com/DevanshuNEU/moderkit-extension

Key features that align with Dex:
• Real-time content analysis with persistent memory
• Browser-based AI integration using modern patterns  
• Cross-session learning and context awareness
• Performance-optimized with <100ms analysis times

With 2+ years full-stack experience and proven browser extension expertise, 
I can contribute to Dex from day one.

Ready to demo live in Chrome Developer Mode.

Best,
Devanshu Chicholikar
